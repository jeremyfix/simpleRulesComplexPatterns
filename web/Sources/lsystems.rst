----------

L-Systems are rewriting systems based on rules. These are symbolic systems, where you define a vocabulary, a set of rules, a stem and then iterate the rewritting rules. A rewritting rule is simply a rule which maps a set of symbols to another set of symbols. One can actually define simple rules that engender complex patterns.

The chaos game
==============

.. include:: start_section.rst 


The chaos game was introduced by Michael Barnsley. It consists in repeatidly applying a function `f` starting from a point `x_0`. This leads to a sequence of points that can, eventually, produce a pattern. The function `f` can comprise several deterministic rules that are selected randomly with fixed probabilities.
